# Static Ray-Tracer in Java from Scratch

*a static ray tracer made in java from "scratch"*


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Ray-Tracing is a fascinating but demanding technique for rendering. This is my go at it using Java doing it as "from the ground up" as possible.

What this Ray-Tracer is:
* A "static" Ray-Tracer, meaning it does not currently render a scene at runtime with user input for navigation. Rather, it renders a .png image of the programmed scene which includes different Objects and Lighting.
* A venture into linear algebra and Ray-Tracing acceleration techniques
* Probably a lot of fun, you should check it out :smile:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Using the Ray-Tracer

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

A simple setup of Java and JavaFX should suffice. More will be added to this section if the project requires any other prerequisites to run it. <br>
For Beginners: If you've never used JavaFX, make sure to follow the official documentation well and set all the libraries up correctly in the IDE that you clone the repo into.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use the Ray-Tracer, simply clone the repo and run the Main.java class. This should create a .png image of the scene. It will be output in the project directory, where you can view it!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Set up multithreaded rendering of .png image of scene
- [x] Simple Sky-Gradient
- [x] Intersections with multiple spheres
- [ ] Lighting, Shadows and Anti-Aliasing (MSAA)
- [ ] Reflections and modular "RTX on"-Mode
- [ ] Bounding volume hierarchy for faster intersections

## Acknowledgments

This Code has been built with inspiration from the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" - series by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, and Steve Hollasch as well as being largely built off of my learnings from the course IN0039 at the Technical University of Munich!
